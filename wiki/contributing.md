# Contributing to the 50by35 Microdata Pipeline Book

## Who This Guide Is For

This guide is for anyone contributing chapters, edits, or code to this Quarto book,
including researchers, economists, and data analysts who may be new to Quarto.
Instructions are written for **Windows** users. macOS notes are included where the
steps differ.

> **IDE:** This project uses [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) as the recommended
> IDE.

---

## One-Time Setup

### 1. Install Git

Download from https://git-scm.com/downloads and run the installer. Accept all defaults.

Verify the installation by opening **Command Prompt** (`Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter)
and running:

```
git --version
```

> **macOS:** Install via Homebrew (`brew install git`) or the Xcode Command Line Tools
> (`xcode-select --install`).

### 2. Install Quarto

Download the Windows installer (`.msi`) from https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/ and
run it. Verify in Command Prompt:

```
quarto --version
```

It should report version ≥ 1.4.

> **macOS:** Download the `.pkg` installer from the same page.

### 3. Install R and Positron

1. Download R from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ and run the installer.
2. Download **Positron** from https://positron.posit.co/ and run the installer.

Positron is a modern IDE built specifically for data science with R and Python. It has
a built-in terminal, a data viewer, and native Quarto support.

> **macOS:** The same Positron download page has a macOS installer.

### 4. Install R packages

Open Positron, then open the **Console** panel (bottom of the screen) and run:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "haven", "knitr", "gt", "ggplot2", "scales", "here"))
```

> If your team decides to use `renv` for stricter package version control, see
> [`wiki/renv-guide.md`](renv-guide.md) instead.

### 5. Install Stata (only if you will write Stata code)

Stata must be installed on your machine. Most team members will already have it.
See [`wiki/r-and-stata-usage.md`](r-and-stata-usage.md) for how to configure Stata
so Quarto can find it.

### 6. Clone the repository

Open **Git Bash** (installed with Git) or the **Positron Terminal** and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GPID-WB/50by35-pipeline.git
```

Then open the `50by35-pipeline` folder in Positron: **File → Open Folder…** and select the
`50by35-pipeline` folder. Positron will detect it as an R project automatically.

## Workflow for Contributing

1. **Create a branch** for your work. In the Positron Terminal:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-name/chapter-topic
   ```

2. **Edit or create** your `.qmd` chapter in `chapters/`. You can open any `.qmd`
   file directly from the Explorer panel on the left.

3. **Preview locally** before pushing. In the Positron Terminal:
   ```bash
   quarto preview
   ```
   This opens a live browser preview. Changes are reflected on save.

4. **If you wrote or modified Stata chunks**, render the full book locally first:
   ```bash
   quarto render
   ```
   Then commit the `_freeze/` folder along with your `.qmd` file.

5. **Commit and push** your branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add baseline methodology for indicator X"
   git push origin your-name/chapter-topic
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub against `main`. Request a review from a teammate.

7. Once approved and merged to `main`, GitHub Actions will automatically rebuild and
   publish the book to GitHub Pages.
